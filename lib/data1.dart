      "The unreal hath no being;\n there is no non-being of the Real;\n the truth about both has beenseen by the knowers of the Truth (or the seers of the Essence).COMMENTARY: What is changing must always be unreal. What is constant orpermanent must always be real. The Atman or the eternal, all-pervading Self ever exists. It is theonly Reality. This phenomenal world of names and forms is ever changing. Names and forms aresubject to decay and death. Hence they are unreal or impermanent.",

What is there to grieve about?COMMENTARY: The physical body is a combination of the five elements. It is perceivedby the physical eye only after the five elements have entered into such combination. After death thebody disintegrates and all the five elements return to their source. The body cannot be perceivednow. It can be perceived only in the middle state.

      "One sees This (the Self) as a wonder;\n another speaks of It as a wonder;\n another hears of Itas a wonder;\n yet, having heard, none understands It at all.COMMENTARY: The verse may also be interpreted in this manner: he that sees, hearsand speaks of the Self is a wonderful man. Such a man is very rare. He is one among manythousands. Therefore, the Self is very hard to understand.",

      "In this there is no loss of effort, nor is there any harm (the production of contrary resultsor transgression). Even a little of this knowledge (even a little practice of this Yoga) protects onefrom great fear.COMMENTARY: In Karma Yoga (selfless action) even a little effort brings immediatepurification of the heart. Purification of the heart leads to fearlessness.",

      "Flowery speech is uttered by the unwise, who take pleasure in the eulogising words ofthe Vedas, O Arjuna, saying: “There is nothing else!”COMMENTARY: Unwise people who lack discrimination place great stress upon theKarma Kanda or ritualistic portion of the Vedas which lays down specific rules for specific actionsfor the attainment of specific fruit. They extol these actions and rewards unduly.",
      "Full of desires, having heaven as their goal, they utter speech which promises birth as thereward of one’s actions, and prescribe various specific actions for the attainment of pleasure andpower.",

Free yourself from the pairs of opposites and ever remain in the quality of Sattwa(goodness), freed from the thought of acquisition and preservation, and be established in the Self.COMMENTARY: Guna means attribute or quality. It is substance as well as quality.Nature is made up of three Gunas—Sattwa (purity, light, harmony), Rajas (passion, restlessness,motion), and Tamas (inertia, darkness). The pairs of opposites are pleasure and pain, heat and cold,gain and loss, victory and defeat, honour and dishonour, praise and censure.",
      "To the Brahmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of as much use as is areservoir of water in a place where there is a flood.COMMENTARY: Only for a sage who has realised the Self are the Vedas of no use,because he is in possession of knowledge of the Self. This does not, however, mean that the Vedasare useless. They are useful for neophytes or aspirants who have just started on the spiritual path.",
      "Thy right is to work only, but never with its fruits;\n let not the fruits of actions be thymotive, nor let thy attachment be to inaction.COMMENTARY: Actions done with expectation of its rewards bring bondage. If you donot thirst for them, you get purification of heart and ultimately knowledge of the Self.",
      "Perform action, O Arjuna, being steadfast in Yoga, abandoning attachment andbalanced in success and failure! Evenness of mind is called Yoga.",
      "Far lower than the Yoga of wisdom is action, O Arjuna! Seek thou refuge in wisdom;\nwretched are they whose motive is the fruit.COMMENTARY: Actions done with evenness of mind is the Yoga of wisdom. Actionsperformed by one who expects their fruits are far inferior to the Yoga of wisdom wherein the seekerdoes not seek the fruits. The former leads to bondage, and is the cause of birth and death.",
      "Endowed with wisdom (evenness of mind), one casts off in this life both good and evildeeds;\n therefore, devote thyself to Yoga;\n Yoga is skill in action.COMMENTARY: Actions which are of a binding nature lose that nature when performedwith equanimity of mind.",
      "The wise, possessed of knowledge, having abandoned the fruits of their actions, andbeing freed from the fetters of birth, go to the place which is beyond all evil.COMMENTARY: Clinging to the fruits of actions is the cause of rebirth. Man has to take abody to enjoy them. If actions are done for the sake of God, without desire for the fruits, one isreleased from the bonds of birth and death and attains to immortal bliss.",
      "When thy intellect crosses beyond the mire of delusion, then thou shalt attain toindifference as to what has been heard and what has yet to be heard.COMMENTARY: The mire of delusion is identification of the Self with the body andmind.",

      "He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after pleasures, and whois free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady wisdom.",
      "He who is everywhere without attachment, on meeting with anything good or bad, whoneither rejoices nor hates, his wisdom is fixed.",

      "From anger comes delusion;\n from delusion the loss of memory;\n from loss of memory thedestruction of discrimination;\n from the destruction of discrimination he perishes.",

      "For the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses, carries away hisdiscrimination as the wind (carries away) a boat on the waters.",
      "Therefore, O mighty-armed Arjuna, his knowledge is steady whose senses arecompletely restrained from sense-objects!",
      "That which is night to all beings, then the self-controlled man is awake;\n when all beingsare awake, that is night for the sage who sees.COMMENTARY: The sage lives in the Self;\n this is day to him. He is unconscious ofworldly phenomena;\n this is like night to him. The ordinary man is unconscious of his real nature. Solife in the Self is like night to him. He experiences sense-objects;\n this is day to him.",
      "He attains peace into whom all desires enter as waters enter the ocean, which, filled fromall sides, remains unmoved;\n but not the man who is full of desires.",

I deem it asdifficult to control as to control the wind.COMMENTARY: The mind ever changes its point of concentration from one object toanother. So it is always restless. It is not only restless but also turbulent and impetuous, strong andobstinate. It produces agitation in the body and in the senses. That is why the mind is even moredifficult to control than to control the wind.",
